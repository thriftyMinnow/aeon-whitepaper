The paper is written using LaTeX.  <br />
The files are organized with a "main" file called aeon-whitepaper.tex, which is the one that should be compiled via TeXstudio or similar. Each main section is in a separate file within the **sections** subfolder.  All images are in the **images** subfolder.

When making a pull request, the corresponding rendered aeon-whitepaper.pdf should also be included if possible.
